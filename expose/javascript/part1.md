2. Line 13 prints `final result: 20`.
3. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`.
4. The code will return an error because the `result` variable is defined in the block above line 13, and since it is declared using `let`, it cannot be accessed at this point.
5. The code will return an error because the `result` variable is declared using `const`, meaning it cannot be changed, but line 7 attempts to do that. 
6. The code will return an error because the `result` variable is defined in the block above line 13, and since it is declared using `const`, and therefore cannot be accessed at this point.
